**Gwent Of Thrones** is an exciting card game that combines the strategic depth of Gwent from The Witcher with the epic universe of Game Of Thrones. Do you have what it takes to dominate the seven kingdoms through your cards? Prepare your deck, face your friends in epic duels, and prove your tactical prowess in a game that will challenge your strategic mind.

## Description

Gwent Of Thrones is a multiplayer card game for two players, where each match is an intense battle of wits. Each player starts with 10 cards and chooses their strategy to win rounds by accumulating the most power on the board. The game is inspired by the popular Gwent, but with a thematic twist that brings it into the gritty and ruthless world of Game Of Thrones.

### Game Features

   *  **Gwent-Inspired**: Follows the basic structure of Gwent, focusing on tactics and strategy.
   *  __Game Of Thrones Aesthetic__: Cards are designed with elements from the iconic universe of George R. R. Martin.
   *  __Online Multiplayer__: Challenge your friends in one-on-one matches.
